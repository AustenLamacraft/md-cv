# Abstract

We study the finite temperature dynamical structure factor \\(S(k,\omega)\\) of a 1D Bose gas using numerical simulations of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation appropriate to a weakly interacting system. The lineshape of the phonon peaks in \\(S(k,\omega)\\) has a width \\( \propto k^{3/2} \\) at low wavevectors. This anomalous width arises from resonant three-phonon interactions, and reveals a remarkable connection to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang universality class of dynamical critical phenomena.
