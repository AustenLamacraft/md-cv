# Abstract

We study a system of spins (qubits) coupled to a common noisy environment, each precessing at its own frequency. The correlated noise experienced by the spins implies long-lived correlations that relax only due to the differing frequencies. We use a mapping to a non-Hermitian integrable Richardson-Gaudin model to find the exact spectrum of the quantum master equation, and hence determine the decay rate. Our solution can be used to evaluate the effect of inhomogeneous splittings on a system of qubits coupled to a common bath.
